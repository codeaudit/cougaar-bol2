		    The Node configuration file contains the agents which make up the node, as well as components which are part of the NodeAgent.<br>
		    Below is an example Node Configuration file named TestNode.ini:
			<br><pre>
			[ Clusters ]
			cluster = AgentA
			cluster = AgentB
			cluster = AgentC
			

			</pre>
			In this example the <i>TestNode</i> Node configuration file identifies three agents to be loaded into the TestNode Node: AgentA, AgentB, and AgentC.
			When the node is being loaded, it looks for agent configuration files following the naming covention [AGENT_NAME].ini.  Therefore, for our TestNode Node, there also needs to be a corresponding agent configuration file for AgentA named AgentA.ini, AgentB called AgentB.ini and AgentC called AgentC.ini
